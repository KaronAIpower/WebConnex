# Connex Website
The Connex website is a web application that provides a platform for users to find genuine connections, whether it's for friendship or romantic relationships. The website features a visually appealing design, a navigation bar, a hero section, a form for personal information, and a footer.

## Technologies Used
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript

## File Structure
The project consists of three files:

+ index.html: This is the main HTML file that defines the structure and content of the website.
+ styles.css: This CSS file defines the styles for the various elements of the website, such as the navigation bar, hero section, form, and footer.
+ app.js: This JavaScript file contains the logic for the website's functionality, including the "Begin your journey" button, the form's age validation, and any other interactive features.

## Features
+ Navigation Bar: The website has a navigation bar that includes a logo, links to different sections (Home, About Us, Product), and a login button.
+ Hero Section: The hero section features a background image and a call-to-action button labeled "Begin your journey".
+ Personal Information Form: When the user clicks the "Begin your journey" button, a form appears where the user can enter their name, email, date of birth, and select their reason for being on the website (finding friends, having a romantic relationship, or unsure).
+ Age Validation: The JavaScript code in the app.js file includes a function to calculate the user's age based on the date of birth entered in the form. If the user is under 18, a message is displayed indicating that they are too young for the website.
+ Footer: The website includes a simple footer with a "I'm a footer" message.

## Usage
1. Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the Connex website.
2. Click the "Begin your journey" button to open the personal information form.
3. Fill out the form and click the "Submit" button.
4. If the user is under 18, a message will be displayed indicating that they are too young for the website.

## Customization
To customize the Connex website, you can modify the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as needed. For example, you can change the branding, update the content, or add additional features and functionality.
